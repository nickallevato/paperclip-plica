/**
 * Deciding whether demo mode is on, before a single real byte is rendered.
 *
 * Two switches, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. `?demo=1` / `?demo=0` on the Plica URL. Costs no network at all and
 *    sticks for the browser session, which is what you actually want mid
 *    walkthrough — flip it in the address bar and every later navigation
 *    inside the app stays in demo.
 * 2. The `demoMode` box on the host's plugin settings page. This is the
 *    durable, discoverable setting, but Paperclip stores plugin config per
 *    company while Plica is a cross-company page — so reading it costs one
 *    `/api/companies` call to learn which config row to ask for. That call is
 *    made with a bare `fetch` (not `host/api`), returns only ids, and nothing
 *    it returns is ever rendered.
 *
 * The URL parameter is remembered in `sessionStorage`, because it is an
 * explicit choice that has to survive a route hop: Plica's cross-company links
 * do a full document load, so an override that lasted only as long as the
 * query string would evaporate the moment you clicked anything.
 *
 * But it is remembered *conditionally*, and that condition is the whole point
 * of this module. A remembered override is stored alongside the configured
 * value it was overriding. On the next mount the config is read again, and:
 *
 *   - config unchanged → the override still stands (you said `?demo=0`, and
 *     nobody has touched the setting since, so you stay out of demo);
 *   - config changed   → the override is dropped (someone has since ticked or
 *     unticked the box, which is a more recent instruction than your URL).
 *
 * The earlier version stored the override unconditionally, which meant a
 * single `?demo=0` — the exact thing this file's own error message tells you
 * to use — silently disabled the settings checkbox for the rest of the tab's
 * session, with nothing on screen to say why. Config is therefore read on
 * every mount, unconditionally; the requests are small and the alternative is
 * a setting that cannot be trusted to do anything.
