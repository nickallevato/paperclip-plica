 * The worker entrypoint is split into `plugin.ts` (lifecycle) and `worker.ts`
 * (the `runWorker` call) precisely so this suite can import the lifecycle
 * without `runWorker` taking over stdio.
 *
 * The install failed once with "Worker process exited (code=0, signal=null)"
 * because the original worker exported a bare object and never called
 * `runWorker`, so the process ran to completion instead of serving JSON-RPC.
