# The Queue

The queue — headed **Needs you** — is every item across every company that is
waiting on a human, in one list, in the order you should work it.

## What lands in it

| Kind | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- |
| **Questions** | `ask_user_questions` interactions on an issue thread. |
| **Confirmations** | Other issue-thread interactions waiting on a response. |
| **Approvals** | Pending approvals. |
| **Heartbeats** | A CEO agent whose heartbeat is overdue. |
| **Failed runs** | Failed runs and agent error alerts. |
| **Routines** | Schedules that stopped firing or whose last run failed. |
| **Blockers** | Blocker attention items. |
| **Other** | Anything else in the attention feed. |

Dismissed attention items are not shown. Approvals appear once, not twice, even
though the attention feed also emits an item for each of them.

## Decide by

By default the queue groups by **when you said you'd decide** — Paperclip's
decision triage, the same *decide by* and *snooze* its own Decisions page
sets. A day chosen in Plica is the day Paperclip shows, and the other way
round.

- **Today** — due today, or overdue. An item whose date has passed says
  *overdue · was due …* in brick.
- **Unsorted** — nothing set yet. This is the new pile: each row carries
  **Today · This week · Whenever** inline, so sorting it is one click a row.
- **This week** — due by Sunday.
- **Alerts** — conditions Plica spots itself (an overdue CEO heartbeat, a
  routine that stopped firing). They have no triage; they leave when the
  condition clears.
- **Whenever** — no deadline, or a date beyond this week. Starts folded.
- **Snoozed** — hidden until the snooze ends. Starts folded, and appears in no
  other grouping.

The header counts what matters for the day: *3 today (1 overdue) · 7 unsorted
· 1 snoozed*.

Every row that can be triaged has a calendar button at the end:

![A row's triage menu: decide by, snooze, archive](screenshots/queue-triage-menu.png)

- **Decide by** Today, This week or Whenever — or **Back to unsorted**.
- **Snooze** for 1 hour, 4 hours, until tomorrow 9:00, or a week; **Wake now**
  on a snoozed row.
- **Archive** takes the item off the feed for good (Paperclip keeps it, and
  its Decisions page can revive it).

Changes show at once and are confirmed on the next refetch; if the write
fails, the row goes back and a toast says why.

## The three severity buckets

Grouped by **Severity**, the queue is "how long can this wait":

- **Now** — approvals, critical attention, an overdue CEO heartbeat.
- **Soon** — high-severity attention, routines that stopped firing or failed.
- **Later** — medium and low severity.

Within a bucket, items are ordered by an internal rank and then by age.

## Controls

![The queue's controls: grouping, sort, and the age filter chips](screenshots/queue-controls.png)

**Grouping** — Decide by, Severity, Org, Kind, Project, Age. Persisted per browser.

**Sort** — `oldest` or `newest`. This is only the age tiebreaker: severity, then
rank inside the bucket, always wins. It decides which of two equally urgent
items you see first, not whether an urgent thing outranks an old one. Items with
no timestamp sort last either way.

**Age chips** — All / Today / Yesterday / Last week / Old, with a count on each.
This is a *filter*, not a grouping: the point is to make a 137-item list
readable by putting three quarters of it out of sight, which grouping alone
cannot do because every group is still on the page. Persisted, because which
slice of the backlog you work is a habit rather than a glance.

The age buckets are calendar days, measured from local midnight — not rolling
hours. An item raised at 9pm last night is *yesterday's* at 8am today, even
though it is eleven hours old. The same buckets drive the Age grouping and the
chips, so the two can never disagree about which pile something is in. An item
with no timestamp reads as today's rather than being buried under "Old".

**Company focus** — clicking an org in the Orgs list filters the queue to that company; a
"Show all companies" control appears while the filter is on. Not persisted.

## Grouping by company

Reads as a per-company worklist. Useful when you are going to sit down and clear
one company.

## Grouping by project

Cuts the same items the other way, which is how you find the one project quietly
generating half the noise.

## Acting on an item

Actions are inline, so you rarely need to open the company:

![Inline Approve and Reject on an approval](screenshots/queue-actions.png)

- **Approve / Reject** on an approval.
- **Answer** on a question, **Choose** on a confirmation — including structured
  `ask_user_questions` responses, with each question's options in place.
- **Open ↗** on anything, which takes you to the item in its own company.

Clicking the excerpt under a headline expands the full prompt in place. For
thread interactions the feed only carries a server-truncated excerpt, so
expanding fetches the payload and shows every question; for anything else it
just unclamps the text.

A partly-typed answer is kept as a draft, so a poll that arrives mid-sentence
does not lose what you have written.

Cross-company links do a **full page load** rather than an in-app transition.
That is deliberate and is a workaround for a core defect: an in-app hop across
company prefixes leaves the host's sidebar pointing at the previous company for
the rest of the session.

## When it is empty

The empty state says which kind of empty it is — "Nothing needs you right now",
"Nothing from *Acme Robotics* needs you", or "Nothing here from today" — so you
can tell an actually-clear queue from a filter you forgot you set.
