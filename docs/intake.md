# Intake and triage

One path from a request to a merged change. Every request travels it; nothing
travels anything else.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` owns the second half — branches, pull requests, CI, the review
gate. This document owns the first half, and names the two places the repository
owner has to say something before work continues.

## The path

```
request  ──▶  captured  ──▶  triaged  ──▶  scoped  ──▶  building  ──▶  in review  ──▶  merged  ──▶  released
             (issue, no      (deduped,     (AC +        (branch,      (PR, second     (main)     (CHANGELOG,
              triage yet)     clarified)    priority)    commits)      party reads)                issue closed)
                                  │
                                  ├──▶ duplicate   (closed, points at the original)
                                  ├──▶ parked      (real, not now — stays open)
                                  └──▶ core limitation (own lane, §7)
```

Two of those arrows are the owner's, not an agent's:

| Gate | Where | Who | What happens without it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Priority** | `triaged` → `scoped` | Repository owner | The issue sits at `needs-priority`. An agent may scope it; nobody starts building. |
| **Merge** | `in review` → `merged` | Repository owner, or a reviewing agent who is not the author | The pull request stays open. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`, "The review gate". |

Everything between those two gates runs without asking. Everything outside them
still gets *reported*, never decided.

## 1. Capture

A request is captured the moment it is written down somewhere with a URL. Until
then it does not exist, and "I'll remember it" is how it stops existing.

Requests arrive from:

- **A GitHub issue**, opened from a template — the normal path, and where every
  other path ends up.
- **A Paperclip comment or task** — the owner asking an agent directly.
- **Discord**, once the bridge in PLI-7 exists.

Whoever picks the request up files a GitHub issue **the same working session**,
using the template that fits (§9). The issue is the request's permanent address;
a Paperclip task or a Discord thread is a place the request was *mentioned*.

Capture verbatim first. A request rewritten before it is recorded loses the
detail the requester thought was worth saying, and no later question recovers
it. Paraphrase in the scope section, below the quote — never over it.

A captured issue carries `needs-triage` and nothing else. That label is the
promise that someone will look; it comes off in §2–4, never by being forgotten.

## 2. Deduplicate

Before anything else, and in this order — the cheapest check that can close an
issue runs first:

1. **The punch list.** The `current-state` document on PLI-2 holds the audited
   feature inventory and a 15-item prioritized punch list. Most "Plica should…"
   requests about existing behaviour are already item *n* there. Check it first,
   every time.
2. **Open GitHub issues**, including `parked` ones. Search the words the
   requester used, then the words *we* would have used — these differ, and
   searching only your own vocabulary is how the same request gets filed twice.
3. **Closed GitHub issues, last 90 days.** A request closed as `wontfix` or
   `parked` that comes back from a second requester is not a duplicate to close
   again — it is evidence the decision was wrong. Reopen it and say who else
   asked.
4. **Paperclip tasks** in the Plica project, including `done` ones.
5. **`CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased".** The thing may already be built and
   simply not released yet — the requester is running an older build.

### What counts as a duplicate

Same *problem*, not same *solution*. Two requests proposing opposite fixes for
one problem are one issue with two options in it. Two requests proposing the
same fix for genuinely different problems are two issues.

When a request is a duplicate:

- Close the newer one with `duplicate`, linking the original.
- **Move anything new across first** — a second reproduction, a use case the
  original lacked, a stronger argument for priority. Then say so on the original.
  A closed duplicate that took its evidence with it made the backlog worse.
- Tell the requester where their request went, and that it is still open there.

When it is a **near**-duplicate — overlapping but not the same problem — keep
both open and link them in each direction. Do not merge them to tidy the count;
two linked issues scope correctly, one merged issue scopes as neither.

## 3. Clarify

Ask only what changes the outcome. Every round trip costs the requester time
they did not volunteer, so a question has to earn itself: if both answers lead
to the same issue, do not ask it — write down the assumption instead and move on.

Worth asking:

- **What were you trying to do?** The request is usually a proposed solution.
  The problem behind it often has a cheaper one, and sometimes already ships.
- **How often, and what do you do now?** Separates "irritating once" from "every
  morning". This is most of a priority proposal.
- **Which surface, which company, what did you see?** For anything that sounds
  like a bug.

Not worth asking: anything answerable by reading the repo, the punch list, or
the current-state report. Do that reading first.

Label `needs-info` while waiting, and say in the comment what happens if there
is no answer. **Fourteen days of silence parks the issue**; it does not close
it. A parked issue is still findable, still countable, and reopens on one
sentence from anyone.

## 4. Scope, and propose a priority

The output of triage is an issue an engineer can start from without another
conversation. One shape, always — the templates in §9 produce it directly:

> **Problem** — what is wrong or missing, and for whom. No solution here.
> **Proposed scope** — what this change does, and explicitly what it does not.
> **Acceptance criteria** — checkable statements. A reviewer must be able to
> mark each one true or false without asking the author what was meant.
> **Open questions** — everything still unknown, each with a named owner.

Acceptance criteria are the load-bearing part. "The board loads faster" is not
one. "The board's first paint happens without waiting on `/api/agents`, verified
by a test that fails when the call is made eagerly" is.

If the scope will not fit one pull request, split it into issues that each fit
one, and link them from a parent. A branch is one change; an issue that cannot
be one change cannot be one branch either.

### Then propose the priority — do not set it

| Band | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | The development loop or an install is broken. Everything waits. | `pnpm test` fails on a clean checkout. |
| **P1** | Shipped behaviour is wrong, or the manifest promises something that does nothing. | A settings field that is silently ignored. |
| **P2** | A documented rule nothing enforces; drift that will bite on a host upgrade. | Vendored host copies with no drift check. |
| **P3** | Documentation accuracy, cleanup, unreachable code. | A README line describing a retired feature. |

Write the proposal into the issue with **one sentence of reasoning and the
strongest argument against it**. A triage agent that only ever argues for its
own ranking is a rubber stamp with extra steps, and the owner cannot audit a
ranking whose counter-argument was never written down.

Then apply `needs-priority` and stop. The owner accepts, or changes it, and the
band becomes a `p0`–`p3` label. **No agent applies a `p0`–`p3` label on its own
authority** — including this one. Nothing gets built until that label is on.

## 5. From issue to merged change

Once the priority label is on, the issue is `ready`:

1. **A Paperclip task is created** and assigned (§6). Both records now exist.
2. The engineer branches `<issue-key>/<kebab-slug>` — `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
   "Branches". Label the issue `in-progress`.
3. A pull request opens with `Closes PLI-n`, filling in the three questions in
   the pull request template. Label `in-review`.
4. CI runs `branch name`, `plugin surface`, `build and test`.
5. **Someone who did not write it reviews and merges it.** Never the author.
6. Merge closes the issue, resolves the Paperclip task, and — for anything
   user-facing — lands a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under **Unreleased** in the same
   pull request, not a follow-up. A changelog written later is written from the
   diff, and the diff does not know why.
7. Reply to the requester on the original issue with the merge commit. The
   request is not finished when the code lands; it is finished when the person
   who asked has been told.

## 6. GitHub and Paperclip

Both exist and neither is going away, so the split has to be stated rather than
improvised.

**GitHub is the system of record for the request. Paperclip is the system of
record for the work.**

| | GitHub issue | Paperclip task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Answers | *What was asked, and what did we decide?* | *Who is doing it, and where is it?* |
| Holds | Problem, scope, acceptance criteria, discussion, the priority decision | Assignee, status, agent runs, comments, blockers |
| Lives | Forever, next to the code | Until the work is done |
| Who reads it | Anyone, including future contributors | The team and the owner's board |

Sync is **manual and one-directional at three moments** — deliberately, because
nothing here is worth a webhook that can fail silently:

1. **Task created from issue.** The Paperclip task's title matches the issue
   title, and its description opens with the issue URL. The GitHub issue gets a
   comment naming the `PLI-n` identifier. Neither record can now be found
   without finding the other.
2. **Status changes.** The GitHub label follows the Paperclip status:
   `ready` → `in-progress` → `in-review` → closed. The labels are the public
   view of a board most readers cannot see.
3. **Done.** The pull request closes the issue; the agent resolves the task with
   the pull request URL in its final comment.

If the two disagree, **the GitHub issue wins on scope and decisions; the
Paperclip task wins on status.** Each is authoritative for exactly what it is
closest to.

Some Paperclip tasks have no GitHub issue — agent housekeeping, spikes, this
document. That is fine. **Every GitHub issue that reaches `ready` has a
Paperclip task**, because unassigned ready work is how things get lost.

## 7. Core limitations

A request that cannot be built inside the plugin surface is **not** a Plica
issue and never becomes one. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, "When the plugin surface is not
enough", is binding: stop, do not route around it.

Triage routes it out of the normal flow instead:

1. File it with the **core limitation** template (§9): what Plica needs, the
   closest extension point, why it falls short, the smallest core change that
   would fix it, and the degraded fallback Plica can ship today.
2. Label `core-limitation`. It never gets a `p0`–`p3` band — it is not our work
   to rank.
3. It goes to the owner as a decision, not to an engineer as a task.
4. Any Plica issue blocked by it links to it and ships the fallback or waits.
   **Do not merge a workaround while waiting.**

Three are already open as Paperclip tasks: PLI-8, PLI-9, PLI-10.

## 8. Backlog hygiene

Weekly, and it takes about twenty minutes:

- **Every `needs-triage` issue older than 3 days** gets triaged or gets a
  comment saying when it will be. Nothing gets lost is the first priority, and
  an untouched label is the failure mode with no alarm on it.
- **Every `needs-info` issue older than 14 days** is parked, with a comment.
- **Every `in-progress` issue with no commit in 7 days** gets asked about. Either
  it is blocked — say by what and by whom — or it is not really in progress.
- **Every `parked` issue is re-read once a month.** Not to close it: to check
  whether it is now cheap, now duplicated, or now shipped by accident.
- **`needs-priority` issues are listed for the owner in one message**, not
  chased one at a time. Priority is a comparison; asking about one issue in
  isolation invites an answer that is wrong against the others.

Anything closed as `wontfix` needs the owner's sign-off first. An agent may
recommend it — an agent may not decide it. A request closed by the team that
received it is the single fastest way to stop receiving requests.

## 9. The templates

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` holds three, and they produce the §4 shape directly so
that triage is filling gaps rather than restructuring prose:

| Template | For | Lands as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feature_request.yml` | New behaviour, or behaviour that should change | `enhancement`, `needs-triage` |
| `bug_report.yml` | Shipped behaviour that is wrong | `bug`, `needs-triage` |
| `core_limitation.yml` | Blocked by the plugin surface itself | `core-limitation` |

Blank issues stay enabled. A template that stops someone reporting a real
problem has cost more than the structure it saved — triage can restructure a
sentence; it cannot recover a report that was never filed.

### Labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `needs-triage` | Captured, not yet looked at. Someone will. |
| `needs-info` | Waiting on the requester. Parks after 14 days. |
| `needs-priority` | Scoped, waiting on the owner's band. **Nobody builds yet.** |
| `p0` `p1` `p2` `p3` | The owner's accepted priority. Only the owner sets these. |
| `ready` | Prioritized and scoped. An engineer can pick it up. |
| `in-progress` | A branch exists. |
| `in-review` | A pull request is open. |
| `parked` | Real, not now. Reopens on one sentence. |
| `core-limitation` | Needs a core change. The owner's decision, not ours. |
| `duplicate` `wontfix` | Closed. `wontfix` needs the owner's sign-off. |

Every issue carries exactly one state label at all times. An issue with none is
lost, which is the one outcome this whole document exists to prevent.
